# Video Game Recommendation App
## Summary
Busy periods at a local video game store lead to longer wait times for customers to receive assistance, as associates aren’t available to help everyone at once. 
This can lead to missed sales opportunities and customer frustration. The proposed solution to better this situation is an in-store kiosk. 
This kiosk will run a video game recommendation application customers can walk up to and in a few questions, be recommended a few titles to pick up while in the store. 
 
## How to use the application:
1. After the application launches, you will be prompted with the question “Are you looking for a game for you, or someone else?” and will need to select one of two buttons.
